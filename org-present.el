;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is meant to be an extremely minimalist presentation tool for
;; Emacs org-mode.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Add the following to your emacs config:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/org-present")
;;   (autoload 'org-present "org-present" nil t)
;;
;;   (add-hook 'org-present-mode-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (org-present-big)
;;               (org-display-inline-images)))
;;
;;   (add-hook 'org-present-mode-quit-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (org-present-small)
;;               (org-remove-inline-images)))
;;
;; Open an org-mode file with each slide under a top-level heading.
;; Start org-present with org-present-mode, left and right keys will move forward
;; and backward through slides. C-c C-q will quit org-present.
;;
;; This works well with hide-mode-line (http://webonastick.com/emacs-lisp/hide-mode-line.el),
;; which hides the mode-line when only one frame and buffer are open.
;;
;; If you're on a Mac you might also want to look at the fullscreen patch here:
;; http://cloud.github.com/downloads/typester/emacs/feature-fullscreen.patch
